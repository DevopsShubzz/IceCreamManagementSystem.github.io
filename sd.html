        <p>“Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm & hard Work.
            The undisputable truth indeed.It all started in early 1980s,
            when this enthusiast decided to be a part of an army clan. 
            But, due to some unforeseen circumstances, he had to alter the plan.
            He hailed from Rajasthan and came down to Ichalkaranji after
            fruitlessly trying his fortune in Belgaon and Mumbai with an 
            indomitable vision and courage to create a mark. Destiny played 
            its own game and this play was here to wait. He has walked the 
            toughest of the paths besides sleeping on the footpaths! All that 
            remained constant was –“HIS ZEST TO MAKE A CHANGE.”</p>
            <p>“An idea can make your life.” Yes! It does. The idea of making an 
            ice cream was out of his inherent desire to spread happiness. 
            As‘ Ice cream’ which is a layman term now, used to be one of the
            sparse dessert at that point in time. With his basics clear on 
            how to make an ice cream, owing to the time he spent in Mumbai ,
            he started selling Mava and Gulkandh ice creams, barefooted, 
            under scorching heat of sun and people started relishing the hawker’s
            delight being the new craze in town.
