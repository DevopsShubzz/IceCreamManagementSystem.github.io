<p>A long time ago, a strong-willed man from Rajasthan came to Ichalkaranji with a vision in mind to do something which would make people remember him forever. Initially, he took up a few jobs but his inner entrepreneurial fire made him quit his job, and thus started the fairytale which today goes by the name of Scoops Of Delights.</p>
<p>“Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm &amp; hard Work. The undisputable truth indeed.It all started in early 1980s, when this enthusiast decided to be a part of an army clan. But, due to some unforeseen circumstances, he had to alter the plan. He hailed from Rajasthan and came down to Ichalkaranji after fruitlessly trying his fortune in Belgaon and Mumbai with an indomitable vision and courage to create a mark. Destiny played its own game and this play was here to wait. He has walked the toughest of the paths besides sleeping on the footpaths! All that remained constant was –“HIS ZEST TO MAKE A CHANGE.”</p>
